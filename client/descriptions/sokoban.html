<b>Input handling</b>
The raw input (key up/down, tap start/end) is stored in an array. All input methods are blended together in this step:

<code>mobileButtonUp.addEventListener("touchstart", () =>
	rawInput[KEY_W] = 1
)
mobileButtonUp.addEventListener("touchend", () =>
	rawInput[KEY_W] = 0
)

document.onkeyup = (e) => {
	switch (e.key) {
		case "w": case "W": case "ArrowUp":
			rawInput[KEY_W] = 0
			break
	}
}
</code>
Now the relative input state, which represents the four possible states of a key (pressed, down, up, and released), is
calculated. This is done by storing the previous frame's input state and matching it with the current one.

<code>UP   && DOWN = PRESSED
DOWN && UP   = RELEASED
UP   && UP   = UP
DOWN && DOWN = DOWN</code>
Then for example, to know if the user has just released the left key (which also encompasses the 'A' key and the left
button for mobile) we'd use this code:

<code>isReleased(input[KEY_A])</code>
<b>Entity system</b>
There are two objects which store references to the entities in the game:
• The layers array, used for rendering each layer in order
• The entity map, used for accessing the tiles by index. Each tile here is an array which may contain several entities
Additionally, a reference to the player entity is stored in a constant.

<b>Pushing entities</b>
For the sake of simplicity, the function for moving the player is the same as the function for pushing a crate. It could
be summarized in these steps:
<ol>
	<li>Check if there is a solid, not pushable object in the target tile. If so, return false.</li>
	<li>If it's a solid but pushable object, try to push the next tile - if it's not possible, the former entity is not pushed either (crates cannot be pushed successively)</li>
	<li>Calculate the new entity position, both in tilemap units and in pixels</li>
	<li>Update the entity data</li>
	<li>Pop the entity's reference from its old position in the entity map, and push it on its new position. Note: the unique entity ID is used here to distinguish the entity which should be removed from the others in the same tile.</li>
</ol>
<b>Rewind system</b>
The rewind system is very basic: each time the user presses a movement key, a snapshot of the current state of the game
is pushed at the top of an array. If the user presses the 'Z' key, the snapshot at the top of the array is popped from
it and used as the new game state.

What I learned - while making the rewind system I had to deal with JavaScript's copying by value vs. reference. The
problem was, if I copied an snapshot by reference, all of the snapshots would be the same - and if I did a deep copy
using the JSON functions, the references to the objects in the game would be lost. So the solution I found was to copy
each value of the snapshot manually.

<b>Rendering</b>
For rendering, WebGL asks for a series of vertices which are going to be used by the shaders. The following function
takes an entity and a target array, grabs the entity's coordinates, texture UVs, and lighting value, and pushes all
these data to the target array in the correct format.
The indices for the vertices are then calculated and passed to the shaders.

The shaders are quite simple.
The vertex shader takes the canvas resolution and vertex position in pixels, and calculates the normalized gl_Position
value.
The fragment shader takes the texture data and calculates the gl_FragColor value.
