<h3>Sokoban</h3>
<b>Input handling</b>
The raw input (key up/down, tap start/end) is stored in an array. All input methods are blended together in this step:

<code>mobileButtonUp.addEventListener("touchstart", () =>
	rawInput[KEY_W] = 1
)
mobileButtonUp.addEventListener("touchend", () =>
	rawInput[KEY_W] = 0
)

document.onkeyup = (e) => {
	switch (e.key) {
		case "w": case "W": case "ArrowUp":
			rawInput[KEY_W] = 0
			break
	}
}
</code>
Now the relative input state, which represents the four possible states of a key (pressed, down, up, and released), is
calculated. This is done by storing the previous frame's input state and matching it with the current one.

<code>UP   && DOWN = PRESSED
DOWN && UP   = RELEASED
UP   && UP   = UP
DOWN && DOWN = DOWN</code>
Then for example, to know if the user has just released the left key, 'A' key, or left button, we'd use this code:

<code>if( isReleased(input[KEY_A]) ) { ... }</code>
<b>Entity system</b>
There are two objects which store references to the entities in the game:
• The layers array, used for rendering each layer in order
• The entity map, used for accessing the tiles by coordinates. Each tile here is an array which may contain several entities.
Additionally there's a constant storing a handle to the player entity, for easy access.

<b>Pushing entities</b>
For the sake of simplicity and cleanliness, the same function (<div class="inline-code">pushEntity</div>) is used for both moving the player and pushing crates. This function can be summarized in the following steps:
<ol>
	<li>Check if there's a solid, not pushable object in the target tile. If so, return false.</li>
	<li>If there's a solid but pushable object, try to push the next tile - if that's impossible, the previously evaluated entity is not pushed either (crates cannot be pushed successively)</li>
	<li>Calculate the entity's new position, both in tilemap units and in pixels</li>
	<li>Update the entity's data</li>
	<li>Move the entity's reference from the old position array in the entity map to the new one. Note: the unique entity ID is used here to distinguish the entity which should be removed from others in the same tile.</li>
</ol>
<b>Rewind system</b>
The rewind system is very basic: each time the player moves the character, a snapshot of the current state of the game is pushed at the top of the <div class="inline-code">history</div> array. If the 'Z' key is pressed, the snapshot at the top of the array is popped and used as the new game state.

<i>What I learned - while making the rewind system I had to deal with JavaScript's way of copying by value vs. reference. The problem was that if I copied an snapshot by reference, all of the snapshots would be the same - and if I did a deep copy using the JSON functions, the references to the entities in the game would be lost. So the solution I found was to copy the values of the snapshot's entities one by one.</i>

<b>Rendering</b>
For rendering, WebGL asks for a series of vertices which are going to be used by the shaders. The following function takes an entity and a target array, grabs the entity's coordinates, texture UVs, and lighting value, and pushes all these data to the target array in the correct format:

<code>function fillEntityVertexData(target, entity)
{
	// Calculate edges
	let x = entity.pos.x
	let y = entity.pos.y
	let x0 = x
	let x1 = x + TILE_SIZE
	let y0 = y
	let y1 = y + TILE_SIZE

	// Get the entity's full texture UV
	// (only the top left and bottom right corners are stored)
	let cornersUV = entity.cornersUV
	completeUV = getUVFromCorners(cornersUV[0], cornersUV[1])

	let lightValue = accessArrayAs2D(lightingMap, entity.tilePos, tilemapWidth)

	target.push(
		x0, y0, ...completeUV[0], lightValue,
		x1, y0, ...completeUV[1], lightValue,
		x0, y1, ...completeUV[2], lightValue,
		x1, y1, ...completeUV[3], lightValue
	)
}</code>
The indices for the vertices are then calculated and passed to the shaders.

The vertex shader takes the canvas resolution and vertex position in pixels, and calculates the normalized gl_Position value. Then the fragment shader takes the texture data and calculates the gl_FragColor value.
