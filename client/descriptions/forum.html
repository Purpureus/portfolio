<h3>CRUD Forum app</h3>
This article describes some of the decisions I took while making this project. Note that I didn't know any React or Node.js before making it, so I took it as a learning project. I learned an incredible amount of things out of it, and even though I was very familiar with JavaScript and other programming languages, I had quite a few headaches trying to get things to work the best way possible.

The main challenge I faced was dealing with the nature of React. As far as I've seen, React encourages the programmer to structure the program in a way that everything relies on state and side effects. Since I was used to write code in a procedural way (do X, then do Y, then do Z), so I had to make a big mindset shift to be able to write proper React code.

One lesson I learned is to leave for the end the implementation of client-side restrictions, such as hiding the "Create post" button while the user isn't logged in. The reason is that, when writing the back-end code, I had to check for possible vulnerabilities which could allow a non-authorised user to perform certain actions. Doing so was way more tedious with a restricted interface and, at the end of the day, client-side restrictions are only UX improvements and don't provide any kind of security (anyone can send requests to the server without the client interface).

<b>The useFetch hook</b>
This hook returns a single function, <div class="inline-code">doFetch</div>, which is defined using <div class="inline-code">useCallback</div> to prevent rendering loops. <div class="inline-code">doFetch()</div> calls <div class="inline-code">fetch()</div> with the provided URL and options, handles any errors that may occur, converts the data using <div class="inline-code">response.json()</div>, and then calls the provided callback function with the returned data and/or errors.

<b>The useLoginData hook</b>
If the user logs in successfully, the server sends a JWT (JSON web token) to the client, along with some additional info. This token is stored in localStoragem, and is sent back to the server when the user makes an action that requires them to be authenticated (for example, when editting or deleting a post).
useLoginData simplifies the act of storing and updating the login data. This hook provides a setter function (setLoginData), the actual login data, and a logOut function. The following is a piece of code that's executed when the user tries to log in:

<code>doFetch(url, options, (data, error) =>
    // ...
    const newLoginData = {
        logged: true,
        username: data.username,
        accessToken: data.accessToken,
    }
    setLoginData(newLoginData)
    // ...
)
</code>
<b>The post draft</b>
When the user is writing a post, they might leave the page and lose what they were writing. While it might be fine to just throw a warning if the user is about to leave, I decided to make something a bit more interesting and implement a post draft which is automatically saved in sessionStorage 1.5 seconds after the user stops typing, and when the user leaves the page.

This was implemented by defining a 1500 millisecond timeout inside a <div class="inline-code">useRef</div>, and refreshing it every time the user types. When the 'Create Post' page is opened, the saved draft is loaded.

<b>Dealing with expired tokens</b>
When submitting a post, the stored access token may already have expired. In that case, the server returns an accessTokenInvalid message, causing a login form to pop up. After successfully logging in, the post contents are preserved, since no page changes occur in the process.
